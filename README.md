- ***unit-tests***: Unit tests for two functions of a counter (increment and decrement);
- ***mockito***: Mocking dependencies for the fetch album use case (jsonplaceholder);
- ***widget-tests***: Widget test example for a simple app containing a title and a message. There's also a scrolling app testing example;
